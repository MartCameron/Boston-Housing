# Boston-Housing
By utilises a dataset of factors that influence Boston house prices (such as crime rate, average number of rooms and pupil/teacher ratio by town), this project uses linear regression to uncover the relationship between these independent variables and the dependent variable (house prices).

The insights gained through the predictive property value model can be used to provide meaningful recommendations to the property industry.
